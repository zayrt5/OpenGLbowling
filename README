NOTES:

I've done what I have done. Coming down to the last few days
I was attempting to get both the ball toss and shadows to work, but I needed to get
at least one done, so I focused on tossing. And I couldn't even get that
100% working. Negative vectors give some strange results still when throwing
the ball.

For the scope of a final project,
it was no where near what I was looking for. It is sloppy messy code, 
with no effort into object orienting the code or optimization.  
Regardless, it looks like a bowling alley and it looks like you throw balls,
so I am proud of that. I attemped hyperboloid-like column ceiling things,
but the effort outweighed the reward vs ball toss feature. Getting the ball
to be visible in front of the camera in fpv was pretty tough as well, not perfected.

I am way more proud of what I have learned though. If I were to implement 
another project in openGL, im sure it would be helluva lot better. 

I have a recurring thought that I may be
depressed by the way I struggle with putting motivation 
into  even interesting material. 
I absolutely adored the time I spent on this project and 
learning the material, especially because of your passion on the subject, Vlakkies.
I just wish my motivation was larger. I remain happy for the most part,
but motivation is harder to find each day. 
Maybe its ADHD, who knows, whatever, excuses.

As a final note, I never intended to take this class in the first place, but I needed
student loans. I am so glad that this was the class I took. I only wish it could
be in person.

I hope to find the passion you have for learning.

Cheers.
